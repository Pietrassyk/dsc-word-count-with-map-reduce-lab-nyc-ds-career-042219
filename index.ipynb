    "# Word Count with Map-Reduce - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen the key map and reduce operators in spark, and also know when to use transformation and action operators, we can revisit the word count problem we introduced earlier in the section. In this lab, we will use the methods seen in the coding labs to read a text corpus into the spark environment, perform a word count, and try basic NLP ideas to get a good grip on how Map-Reduce performs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the Map-Reduce operation in a big data context\n",
    "* Perform basic NLP tasks with a given text corpus\n",
    "* Perform basic analysis using the experimental findings towards identifying writing styles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Map-Reduce task\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our problem looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have a huge text document\n",
    "* We need to count the number of times each distinct word appears in the document\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Analyze web server logs to find popular URLs\n",
    "    * Analyze texts for content or style "

    "\n",
    "We will illustrate a Map-Reduce computation for counting the number of occurrences for each word in a text corpus. In this example, the input file is a repository of documents and each document is an element. We shall count the frequency of stop words for __style identification__ as stop words might have unique features which can potentially describe the author's writing style based on their use of stop words while writing. We shall look at some texts by Shakespeare and Jane Austin following this motivation. \n",

    "In this simple exercise, we saw Map-Reduce in action for solving a basic NLP task i.e. counting the frequency of stop words and keep words of a text corpus. This exercise can be seen as a first step towards text analytics on big data platforms. After this lab, we will get into more advanced use cases of pyspark, specifically for machine learning applications.\n"
